# 🎯 Guessing Game 🔢
This is a simple number guessing game implemented purely with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts.

# ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Random Number Generation**: A random integer between 1 and 100 is generated at the start of the game.

2. **User Input**: The player enters a guess into the input field.

3. **Validation**: The input is checked to ensure it's a valid number between 1 and 100.

4. **Guess Tracking**:

     The player has a maximum of 10 guesses.

     The code keeps track of previous guesses and the number of remaining attempts.

5. **Feedback**: After each valid guess, the player is told if their guess was too high, too low, or correct.

6. **Game End**: The game ends if the player guesses correctly or runs out of guesses.

7. **New Game**: A "Start new game" button appears, which resets all game variables, generates a new random number, and enables the input field for a fresh round.
